# aws-resource-list
This project contains a simple yet powerful Shell Script that helps you list and monitor AWS resources in your account using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). It can automatically fetch and display resource details (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, IAM users, etc.) from any AWS region.
